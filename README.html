Ih equalizes membrane input resistance in a heterogeneous 
population of fusiform neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Front.
Cell. Neurosci. 10:249. doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00249">10.3389/fncel.2016.00249</a>
 
The paper proposed that Ih expression covaries specifically 
with IKir in order to maintain membrane resistance constant, 
but Ih variations are not relevant for creating the quiet 
and active phenotypes.This was tested varying the maximal 
conductance of gKIR and gh in the neuron model.

Under unix systems:
===================
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui init.hoc

Under Windows:
==============
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll DOS box" and 
follow on-screen instructions.
A double click on the simulation file
init.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

This fusiform model can be used to run a simulation of the
spontaneous firing of a fusiform cell.

To run a simulation of a quiet fusiform cell, the gKIR value is changed to

gkirbar_fuscurr = 0.001

which should produce a graph like

To run a simulation of an active fusiform cell, the gKIR value is changed to

gkirbar_fuscurr = 0.0005

which should produce a graph like
